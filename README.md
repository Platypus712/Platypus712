- 👋 Hi, I’m @Platypus712 rl name Nikola
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, I'm new so I don't have favourite language but currently I'm interested mainly in frontend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html,css and javascript. My goal is to later learn react or angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me to learn html and css but main focus is on js, and projects that can upgrade my knowledge in frontend overall
- 📫 How to reach me: nikolapustisek@gmail.com
